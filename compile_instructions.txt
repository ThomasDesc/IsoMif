To run IsoMif locally on mac or linux, you need 3 programs (GetCleft, Mif and IsoMif). All included in the download. Use the binary files for your architecture. You can also compile the Mif and IsoMIF program on your machine.

--- Compile Mif ---

g++ ./mif.cpp -o ./mif -O3

--- Compile IsoMIF ---

Requires GSL installed and its library (-L) and include (-I) dirs specified like so:

g++ ./isomif.cpp -o ./isomif -O3 -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas -L/path/to/gsl/lib/ -I/path/to/gsl/include/

--- Binaries ---

To use the binaries, open a terminal or console and change directory to the root directory where the download folder was unzipped:

cd /home/john/IsoMif

--- Commands to run perl scripts ---

perl ./mifView.pl -m ./hive/mifs/1E8X.mif -o ./hive/mifView/ perl ./mifView.pl -m ./hive/mifs/1RDQ.mif -o ./hive/mifView/

perl ./isoMifView.pl -m ./hive/match/1E8X_match_1RDQ.isomif -o ./hive/matchView/ -g 1
